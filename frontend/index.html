    <div data-example="depression">
      The patient presents with a 3-month history of persistent low mood and marked loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. They report feeling extremely sad, empty, and hopeless most of the day, nearly every day. Activities and hobbies that once felt engaging now seem meaningless, and they struggle to find motivation to do even basic tasks. Getting out of bed has become increasingly difficult, and the patient describes a sense of emotional and physical heaviness that makes everyday functioning feel overwhelming.
      Sleep is significantly disturbed, with the patient sleeping more than 12 hours per day yet continuing to feel exhausted and unrefreshed. Despite this prolonged sleep, they lack energy and feel fatigued throughout the day. Their appetite has markedly decreased, and they report unintentional weight loss of approximately 15 pounds over this period. The patient frequently feels like a burden to others, with pervasive feelings of worthlessness and excessive self-criticism.
      They describe recurrent thoughts about “not being here anymore,” suggesting the presence of passive suicidal ideation, although no specific plan or intent is detailed in the current description. Cognitive symptoms are also prominent: the patient reports difficulty concentrating, trouble focusing on tasks, and a noticeable decline in their ability to perform at work. They have been missing deadlines and falling behind on responsibilities, which further reinforces their negative self-perception and sense of failure.
      Overall, the symptom pattern—including persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep and appetite, significant weight loss, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, impaired concentration, and suicidal thoughts—over a period of at least 3 months is highly suggestive of a major depressive episode with substantial functional impairment.

    <div data-example="anxiety">
      The patient reports experiencing frequent and intense episodes of fear and panic that occur unexpectedly, without any clear warning signs. These panic attacks are accompanied by a range of distressing physical symptoms, including a rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, dizziness, and a strong sense of impending doom or fear of dying. The duration of these episodes typically lasts between 10 to 20 minutes, and they occur 2-3 times per week. This pattern has persisted for the past two months, with no identifiable triggers or consistent factors that may predict the onset of an attack. The sudden and intense nature of these episodes causes significant distress and discomfort for the patient.
      As a result of these recurrent panic attacks, the patient has begun to exhibit behavioral changes, including avoiding situations where they have previously experienced these distressing symptoms. For example, they have started to avoid public transportation, crowded places, or any setting where they may feel trapped or unable to escape in case another panic attack occurs. This avoidance behavior, which is commonly associated with panic disorder, has progressively limited the patient’s ability to engage in normal daily activities. They also express significant worry and apprehension about when the next episode will happen, which further exacerbates their anxiety and fear.
      The patient’s quality of life has been notably affected, as the constant anxiety and fear of experiencing another panic attack have led to a sense of hypervigilance and avoidance that restricts their ability to fully participate in social, professional, and personal activities. They report that the anxiety surrounding the unpredictability of the attacks has made them more withdrawn and isolated. The distress caused by these attacks, along with the ongoing fear of future episodes, suggests that the patient may be suffering from panic disorder. Treatment options, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological interventions, could be explored to help manage the symptoms and improve the patient’s overall functioning.

    <div data-example="bipolar">
      The patient presents with a history of mood swings characterized by episodes of elevated mood (mania) and periods of depression. During manic episodes, the patient reports experiencing increased energy levels, reduced need for sleep, heightened irritability, and grandiose thinking. They often engage in risky behaviors, such as excessive spending and impulsive decision-making. These manic phases typically last for several days to weeks and are followed by depressive episodes marked by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. The depressive episodes can last for weeks to months and significantly impair the patient's daily functioning.
      The patient also reports difficulty maintaining stable relationships and employment due to the unpredictable nature of their mood fluctuations. There is a family history of bipolar disorder, which may contribute to the patient's condition. The severity and frequency of these mood episodes have led to significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning.
      Given the clinical presentation and history provided, the patient appears to meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder. A comprehensive treatment plan that includes mood stabilizers, psychotherapy, and lifestyle modifications should be considered to manage symptoms and improve overall quality of life.
